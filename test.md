## Aim and Scope

Industrial systems are becoming increasingly complex due to the integration of advanced technologies, the expansion of interconnected networks, and the growing demand for higher efficiency and productivity. This complexity requires more sophisticated modeling and management strategies to ensure reliability and adaptability in dynamic environments. Industrial optimization refers to the application of various techniques aimed at improving the efficiency of processes and operations within industrial systems, with the goal of enhancing performance to make these systems more intelligent, efficient, cost-effective, and productive.

Significant progress has been made in industrial optimization within the context of evolutionary computation. While traditional evolutionary algorithms have successfully addressed many optimization challenges in industrial intelligence, they often exhibit several limitations, such as limited generalizability, an inability to fully exploit problem-specific properties, and reliance on prior domain knowledge. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have gained considerable attention due to their success across a variety of real-world applications, including computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition. The application of LLMs in industrial optimization offers benefits such as enhanced predictive accuracy, improved decision-making capabilities, and greater generalizability across diverse scenarios. By leveraging these strengths, the limitations of evolutionary algorithms in industrial optimization can be mitigated.

This special session, as an event organized by the Task Force on “Large Models for Industrial Optimization” in the Intelligent Systems Application Technical Committee, aims to promote the research on evolutionary computation methods for their applications to the industry.

### Topics of Interest

The topics of this special session include, but are not limited to, the following:

- **LLM Integration with Simulation Engines**: Investigating methods for embedding LLMs and other large AI models into traditional simulation engines, enhancing their ability to predict complex system behaviors.
- **LLM-Enhanced Evolutionary Algorithms**: Developing new algorithms that utilize the computational strengths of LLMs for optimization tasks. 
- **Data-Driven Evolutionary Optimization**: Addressing the issue of time-consuming simulations through collected historical data.
- **Predictive Maintenance Scheduling**: Applying LLMs to predict equipment failures and optimize maintenance schedules. This could involve using LLMs to analyze historical maintenance data and operational parameters to schedule proactive maintenance for industrial machinery.
- **Real-World Application Case Studies**: Conducting detailed case studies to validate the effectiveness of large model-enhanced simulations. This could involve collaborating with industries to implement and assess the impact of these advanced simulations in real-world scenarios.
